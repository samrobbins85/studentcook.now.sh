# Toad in the hole for 4
## Ingredients
 * 12 Chipolatas
 * 1 tbsp sunflower oil
 * 140g plain flour
 * 1/2 tsp Salt
 * 2 eggs
 * 175ml milk

## Method
* Heat oven to 220C/200C fan/gas 7.
* Put the 12 chipolatas in a 20 x 30cm roasting tin with 1 tbsp sunflower oil, then bake for 15 mins until browned.
* Meanwhile, make up the batter mix. Tip 140g plain flour into a bowl with ½ tsp salt, make a well in the middle and crack 2 eggs into it.
* Use an electric whisk to mix it together, then slowly add 175ml semi-skimmed milk, whisking all the time. Leave to stand until the sausages are nice and brown.
* Remove the sausages from the oven – be careful because the fat will be sizzling hot – but if it isn't, put the tin on the hob for a few mins until it is.
* Pour in the batter mix, transfer to the top shelf of the oven, then cook for 25-30 mins, until risen and golden
