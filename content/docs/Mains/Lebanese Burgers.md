# 6 Lebanese Burgers
## Ingredients 
* 1 small onion, finely chopped
* 1 large garlic clove, minced
* 500g ground lean lamb
* 1/4 cup fresh flat leaf parsley, chopped, packed
* 2 tbsp fresh mint leaves, chopped
* 1 tsp ground cumin
* 2 tsp Dijon mustard
* 1 egg
* Salt to taste
* Oil

## Method
1. Heat one teaspoon olive oil in a large non-stick skillet. Saut√© onion and garlic on medium-low heat for about 5 minutes or until soft. Remove from the heat and cool slightly.
2. Transfer onion and garlic to a large mixing bowl. Add ground lamb, parsley, mint, cumin, mustard and egg, and season with salt to taste
3. Using your hands combine the ingredients and form 6 2.5/3-inch (about 7 cm) patties
4. Heat 1/2 tbsp olive oil on high heat in the same skillet. Brown patties, about 1 minute on each side then reduce to medium-low and cook for about 3-4 minutes on each side or until cooked through. You want to cook them gently, so they are browned on the outside and cooked all the way through inside. 
5. Transfer cooked patties to a plate lined with paper towel to drain excess fat.
